Design a clean, modern four-panel (single-fold) pamphlet that showcases an Internal Developer Platform called “Plantora:
Your DevOps Copilot.”

Layout & Structure
• Panel 1 (Front Cover)
• Green or teal-themed background
• Large, bold headline: “Plantora: Your DevOps Copilot”
• Small tagline: “From Code to Production—Faster, Simpler, and with AI-Powered Guidance”
• Minimalistic illustration or icon representing a “copilot” or AI assistant
• Panel 2 (Inside Left)
• White background
• Title: “The Shift-Left Cliff”
• Short paragraph block about developer challenges (ownership overload, tool fragmentation, etc.)
• Simple icon or small chart/graphic to convey complexity
• Panel 3 (Inside Right)
• White background
• Title: “Plantora: Your DevOps Copilot”
• Bulleted features (One-Click Provisioning, Streamlined CI/CD, Centralized Service Discovery, etc.)
• Side-by-side comparison with “GitHub Copilot = coding partner” vs. “Plantora = operations partner”
• Modern icons representing cloud, CI/CD, logs, etc.
• Panel 4 (Back Cover)
• White or matching green background
• Headline: “Reach Out Today!”
• Contact details (placeholder phone, website, email)
• Call-to-action text: “Try Plantora” and “Learn More”
• Small illustration or icon of a person asking questions to an AI or chatbot

Style & Aesthetics
• Minimalist, tech-focused design
• Flat or semi-flat icons; simple, friendly illustrations
• Consistent font hierarchy with bold headings, clean body text
• Balance of white space and vivid color blocks
• Incorporate brand colors (greens/teals) to unify all panels

Additional Notes
• Emphasize a professional yet approachable look, similar to the healthcare pamphlet references but tailored for a
DevOps/productivity theme.
• Include placeholders for short paragraphs and bullet points, with text alignment that is easy to read.
• Keep icons or illustrations consistent in style (outlined or flat).

Generate a high-resolution mockup that a UX designer could use as a reference or starting point to finalize the pamphlet
in Adobe InDesign or Illustrator.
