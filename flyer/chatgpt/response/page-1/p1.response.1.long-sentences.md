Page 1 Title/Headline

	“Hi, I’m Plantora—your co-pilot for DevOps.”

Suggested Visual/Design Tip
* Place a large chatbot graphic or screenshot at the center/top, showing a snippet of an actual chat conversation (e.g.,
deploying a DynamoDB table). This immediately conveys the conversational interface.
* Keep the background clean and minimal, so the conversation screenshot pops.
* Use a friendly avatar or icon that personifies “Plantora” as a helpful assistant.

Brief Intro (in bullet points)
* No More Manual Scripts: Chat your way to provisioning DynamoDB tables, PostgreSQL databases on Kubernetes, or DNS
zones in GCP.
* Simple, Conversational Interface: Forget clunky CLI commands—just type what you need, and Plantora does the heavy
lifting.
* Accelerate DevOps: Automate repetitive tasks, reduce errors, and ship faster.
* Stay in Control: Every action is logged and auditable, so you always know who did what and when.
* Built for Developers, by Developers: We’ve been in your shoes and designed Plantora to solve real-world DevOps pains.

Closing Note
