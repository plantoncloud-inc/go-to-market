Below is a suggested four-panel pamphlet layout (often referred to as a “brochure” or “one-fold pamphlet”) that you can
hand off to your UX designer. The emphasis is on brevity and clarity, helping readers quickly grasp both the problem
your product solves and the unique value of Plantora as a “DevOps Copilot.” The text is structured by panels/pages (
Front Cover, Inside Left, Inside Right, Back Cover) but feel free to adjust as needed for your final design.

1. Front Cover

Headline:

Plantora: Your DevOps Copilot
A Part of Planton Cloud’s Internal Developer Platform

Sub-Headline (Optional):

From code to production—faster, safer, and with less DevOps complexity.

Key Visual Cue:

A simple graphic or icon representing a “copilot” or a futuristic assistant. (Your designer can incorporate your
branding elements.)

Short Teaser Text:

Empower your teams with a centralized platform to bootstrap, deploy, and operate modern software services—backed by
conversational AI to guide you at every step.

2. Inside Left Panel

Section Title:

The Shift-Left Cliff: A Growing Challenge

Problem Overview (Bulleted):
• Ownership Overload: Developers are now responsible for setup, provisioning, deployment, and on-call duties—beyond just
coding.
• High Learning Curve: Mastering infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, security, and compliance can pull focus from
innovation.
• Fragmented Tooling: Multiple services, tools, and scripts increase complexity, leading to errors and inefficiency.
• Slowed Delivery: Managing everything manually reduces developer productivity and delays go-to-market time.

Why It Matters:

Organizations need a unified approach to streamline these tasks and keep developers focused on creating value.

3. Inside Right Panel

Section Title:

Plantora: Your DevOps Copilot

Short Intro Paragraph:

Meet Plantora, part of our Planton Cloud platform—an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) designed to simplify, automate,
and standardize DevOps for modern software teams. Think of it as GitHub Copilot for development meets Plantora for
operations.

Key Benefits & Features (Bulleted):

1. Conversational Interface
   • Chat-based DevOps guidance for provisioning, CI/CD configuration, and troubleshooting.
2. Self-Service Provisioning
   • One-click creation of DynamoDB tables, caches, and other cloud resources—no manual IaC required.
3. Streamlined CI/CD
   • Quick setup of pipelines on GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc., with best practices baked in.
4. Centralized Service Discovery
   • A single source of truth for your entire software landscape—track owners, dependencies, and more.
5. Automated Compliance & Auditing
   • Built-in version control, Terraform/Pulumi diffs, and detailed activity logs keep you secure and compliant.
6. Reduced Cognitive Load
   • Free developers from infrastructure headaches—let them focus on building features.

Comparison Heuristic:
