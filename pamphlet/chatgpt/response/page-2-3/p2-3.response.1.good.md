Below is a suggested layout and concise text for Page 2. This page should feel visually centered on PlantonCloud (our
internal developer platform), with Plantora (the DevOps copilot) woven into the story.

Headline / Title

“PlantonCloud: Your All-in-One Internal Developer Platform”

Visual Direction

* Place PlantonCloud at the center of the page (perhaps as a circle or hub).
* Surround it with labeled “spokes” or icon clusters (like a wheel) for each key capability:
* Bootstrap Services
* Configure GitHub Actions
* Cloud Infrastructure
* App Deployments
* Open-Source on Kubernetes
* Post-Deployment Ops
* Service Discovery
* Somewhere in or around this visualization, feature the Plantora chatbot icon/mascot to show it as the guiding co-pilot
  that interacts with each spoke.

Short Bullet Points / Text Blocks

1. Bootstrap Services

* “Launch new microservices with built-in best practices, no IaC fuss.”

2. CI/CD Made Easy

* “Configure pipelines on GitHub or GitLab in a few clicks—fully customizable.”

3. Cloud Infrastructure

* “Spin up AWS, GCP, or Azure resources seamlessly using Plantora’s chat prompts.”

4. Deploying Services & OSS

* “One-stop solution for deploying your apps and popular open-source projects on Kubernetes.”

5. Post-deployment Operations

* “Attach monitoring, logging, and scaling in seconds, with every step guided by Plantora.”

6. Service Discovery

* “Everything in one place—keep track of owners, configs, and dependencies.”

Closing Thought

“From day one to day two, from code to cloud—PlantonCloud + Plantora is your shortcut to modern DevOps.”

(Remind your designer to keep text minimal, use icons/visual cues for each category, and highlight Plantora’s chat-based
approach throughout.)
