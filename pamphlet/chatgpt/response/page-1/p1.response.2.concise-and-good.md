	“Hi, I’m Plantora—your DevOps copilot.”

Visual Tip
* Place a screenshot of a quick chat example, like:
* User: “Create a DynamoDB table named orders.”
* Plantora: “DynamoDB ‘orders’ table created successfully!”

Short Bullets
* No more manual scripts. Just chat to provision AWS, GCP, or Kubernetes.
* Instant results. Deploy a Postgres DB or DNS zone with a simple request.
* Stay in control. Every change is logged and easy to track.
* Built by devs, for devs. Save time, reduce errors, and ship faster.

Closing Note

	“Think GitHub Copilot for code—now meet Plantora for deployments.”
