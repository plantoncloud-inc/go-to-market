From the photos, this looks like a single-fold pamphlet with four “panels” (pages) laid out as follows when fully
opened:

1. Front (Cover) Panel
   • Color: Green background.
   • Headline/Title: “Introduction: Arogya Sathi.”
   • Short Paragraph: One concise block of text describing what Arogya Sathi is (its vision or mission statement).
   • Visual/Illustration: An image of a healthcare worker wearing a face mask, holding a lightbulb (symbolizing an idea
   or innovation).
   • Tagline: “Revolutionizing Healthcare, One Tap at a Time.”
   • Small Logo/Icon and Website: The bottom-left corner shows an icon labeled “App” and a website URL (
   e.g., “www.arogya4life”).

When folded, this is what people see at first glance.

2. Inside Left Panel (once the pamphlet is opened)
   • Color: White background.
   • Title/Heading: “Arogya Sathi” repeated, or a short phrase about the product.
   • Main Visual/Illustration: A doctor figure holding some medical tools or props.
   • Supporting Content:
   • A short paragraph describing how Arogya Sathi addresses healthcare challenges.
   • A pie chart or small infographic illustrating a statistic relevant to the problem space (e.g., number of patients
   served, cost breakdown, etc.).

3. Inside Right Panel
   • Color: White background (matches the inside left for a unified look).
   • Title/Heading: “The Future of Healthcare.”
   • Icons/Bullet Points: Several healthcare-related icons in a row (ambulance, medical records, a hospital building,
   etc.).
   • Short Paragraph: Describes broader trends or future opportunities in healthcare technology—how the market is
   evolving and why Arogya Sathi is well-positioned within it.

4. Back Panel (the reverse side of the inside right panel)
   • Headline/Call to Action: “Reach Out Today!”
   • Paragraph/Contact Info: Explains how to get in touch, possibly offering a phone number, email address, or website.
   Encourages readers to learn more or schedule a demo/meeting.
   • Visual/Illustration: A small character graphic with question marks or icons signifying questions/answers.
   • Action Buttons/Links (if printed, these may just be text):
   • Phone number (e.g., “+91 98765-43210”)
   • Website URL (e.g., “www.arogya4life”)
   • Email (e.g., “info@arogya4life.com”)

When the pamphlet is fully folded back up, this “Reach Out Today” panel ends up being on the outside back.

Summary of the Physical Layout

1. Front Cover (Green): Introduction + tagline + brief overview.
2. Inside Left (White): Deeper explanation of Arogya Sathi + doctor image + chart/graphic.
3. Inside Right (White): “Future of Healthcare” section with icons + short descriptive text.
4. Back Cover (White or Green): “Reach Out Today” with contact details, concluding the pamphlet.

This mirrors the structure seen in the photos: a visually appealing front cover, two inside pages with more details, and
a back cover that focuses on contact/next steps.
